### Part 2

#### 1. Are these three nets live? Explain how did you check this.

Yes, all of the nets are live. 

A net is live if all of it's transitions are live. A transition is live it is enabled  (=can fire) by some sequence of transitions. A transitions liveness can be shown by finding a sequence of transitions that enables it. In this case for all nets all transitions are enabed for example by executing the shortest transition sequences described in subtask 3. 


#### 2. Are these nets bounded? Explain how did you check this.

Yes, all of the nets are bounded.

A net is ```k```-bounded if in all it's reachable markings there is ```k``` so that the amount of tokens in any place is less than ```k+1```. If ```k=1``` the net is safe. If a net is ```k```-bounded it's bounded. In this case for all nets at any reachable marking the amount of tokens in any place is 0 or 1. The nets do not duplicate tokens. This can be checked by looking at the transitions. For all transitions in all nets the amount of incoming and outgoing arcs is the same. Thus the net cannot duplicate or destroy tokens.


#### 3. For each of these nets, what is the length of the shortest firing sequence that leads to a marking in which all odd-numbered places have a token? 

2, 7 and 18 transitions for nets 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

The shortest firing sequence can be found by building a reachability graph and tracing back the shortest sequence from the goal mrking to the initial marking. For small nets a graphical tool would suffice but for nets larger than these a shortes path algorithm would be more feasible.  


#### 4. Can you say something about the length of the shortest path that leads to a marking in which all odd-numbered places have a token?



### Part 3

![Kumpula traffic lights](kumpula.png)

The picture depicts a petri net model for Kumpula traffic lights.

The lights have three possible states:

* Initial state in which traffic is possible in the north-south direction
* Second state in which traffic is possible in the south to side road and side road to south directions
* Third state in which traffic is possible in the north to side road direction

The lights are green in the directions allowed and red in other directions, lights are orange when changing state from green to red but orange lights are not modelled to keep the graph size down. As depicted in the picture in the task description, traffic in the side road to north direction is not possible.

The singular token depicts change of the lights between the three states. The "capacity" places depict the capacity to accept cars in a direction, and are refilled by the light turning green in that particular direction. Since WoPeD does not support a reset arc, it is not possible to model resetting the capacities: instead in this graph the weighted arc to the "capacity" place means setting the number of tokens to the amount determined by the weight.

The "inbound" places depict cars coming from each direction. A new car coming to the intersection would be represented by adding a token in an "inbound" place. The "car from" transitions represent cars moving from a direction to another: this transition is possible only if the light is green in that direction, as it consumes and produces a token with a two-way arc to the appropriate "green" place. It also consumes a token from the "capacity" state, limiting the number of cars that may proceed in that particular direction.
