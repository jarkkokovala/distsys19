# Measurements

## What is the average time for sending 50 messages between two nodes (random payload)?

## Choose 3 different fixed message sizes (payloads for min, average, max), what is the average time when sending 25 in each case?

## Choose a unique payload, e.g., average size, and then measure the inter arrival rate between messages?

## How reliable is your architecture? 

## What kind of applications can benefit from this architectural flavor?
