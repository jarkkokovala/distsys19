## Project Description (the projectâ€™s purpose and core functionality)

For the project 1 we decided to implement a distributed file system (DFS). A DFS is a system of multiple (hundreds to hundred thousands) computers which are connected via a network. It's designed to store and manage a huge amount of files in an availale and fault-tolerant manner. A typical DFS implementation follows a master-worker architecture where a single master node manages a large set of worker nodes.

Our DFS implements only a tiny subset of the features of a real DFS. The focus of our project was to implement the core components of a typical distributed file system: master (the name node), worker (the file node) and client and communication between the components.
