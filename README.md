## Tasks

### Report: 

1) A thorough final report about the project’s purpose and core functionality; 
2) your system design using the 3 principles from the lectures (architecture, processes, communication), 
3) problems encountered, and lessons learned. 
4) Instructions for installation and execution; 
5) Answer the following questions with your implementation: 
    1). What is the average time for sending 50 messages between two nodes (random payload)? 
    2). Choose 3 different fixed message sizes (payloads for min, average, max), what is the average time when sending 25 in each case? 
    3). Choose a unique payload, e.g., average size, and then measure the inter arrival rate between messages? 
    4). How reliable is your architecture? What kind of applications can benefit from this architectural flavor?
